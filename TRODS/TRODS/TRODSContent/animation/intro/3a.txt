For the first time in centuries,
the throne is vacant.
Spark, the eldest son of the king
and best knight of the kingdom
is to become the king of OpenEdge.
All the kingdom is in mourning.
With the exception of Chaos, brother of Spark,
the belligerent temperament and ardent,
who spends his time drinking
and expressing his anger towards
his elder brother.
Chaos could not imagine being anything
but King.
Thus, he set his mind, thirsty for
power and rivalry, to murder his brother.
But his blind anger confused his senses
and he failed miserably.
